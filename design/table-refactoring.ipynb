    "\n",
    "It's time to revisit the way table coordinates work.  In particular, the new design should support the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Columns and rows can be inserted into table coordinates.\n",
    "    * Implies that embedded coordinate system ranges can be altered after construction.\n",
    "* Table data is exportable.\n",
    "    * We will store data as a heteregenous matrix of values.  The values in merged cells will be repeated.\n",
    "* Better table coordinate cell access.\n",
    "    * Allow regular data-table-like cell indexing.\n",
    "        * This will make it easier to do alternating row colors, grouped styles, etc.\n",
    "    * We might-or-might-not get rid of cell(), row(), and column() methods.\n",
    "* Table-aware plot embedding.\n",
    "    * It should be possible to embed a bar plot or a line plot simply by assigning a special \"formatter\" to a row / column.\n",
    "    * The layout of the embedded plot would be affected by cell spacing, gaps, padding, etc.\n",
    "    * The tricky part will be handling formatters that get overridden / are discontiguous.\n",
    "* Efficiency.\n",
    "    * Currently, we store a heavyweight `Cell` data structure for every cell in the table, with lots of redundant information.\n",
    "        * This is inefficient for visualizations that don't need to control every little thing, like `matrix` vis.\n",
    "        * Store cell properties using homogeneous matrix data structures.\n",
    "        * We can store the row heights and column widths globally.\n",
    "    * Merged cells are stored using extra `Cell` data structures that have pointers to their \"parent\" cells, but it's undefined what happens when merging merged cells.\n",
    "        * Handle merging using \"merge groups\" instead.\n",
    "        * Allow merged cells to be split apart by subsequent merges."
