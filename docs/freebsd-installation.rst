FreeBSD Installation
=====================

There is a FreeBSD port for Toyplot, but as with any packaged software it
may-or-may-not be up-to-date ... see the port information at

http://www.freshports.org/graphics/py-toyplot/

and be sure to let the FreeBSD maintainers know (in the nicest way possible)
that you're using Toyplot!
