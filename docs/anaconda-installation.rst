Anaconda Installation
=====================

Whether youâ€™re new to Python or an old hand, we highly recommend installing
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Anaconda includes and
conveniently installs Python and other commonly used packages for scientific
computing and data science, including most of Toyplot's dependencies.

With Anaconda installed, do the following to install Toyplot::

    $ conda install pip numpy multipledispatch reportlab
    $ pip install toyplot

Note that there is a Conda package for Toyplot, but as with all packaged software
installations, it may or may not be up-to-date ... see the package information at

https://binstar.org/melund/toyplot

and be sure to let the Anaconda maintainers know (in the nicest way possible)
that you're using Toyplot!
