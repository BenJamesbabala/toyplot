Anaconda Installation
=====================

Whether youâ€™re new to Python or an old hand, we highly recommend installing
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Anaconda includes and
conveniently installs Python and other commonly used packages for scientific
computing and data science, including most of Toyplot's dependencies.

With Anaconda installed, do the following to install Toyplot::

    $ conda install pip numpy multipledispatch reportlab
    $ pip install toyplot

Note that there is a Conda package for Toyplot, but (as of this writing) it's fairly
out of date ... see the package information at

https://binstar.org/melund/toyplot

and (in the nicest way possible) let the Anaconda maintainers know you're using Toyplot!
