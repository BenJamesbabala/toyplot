Compatibility
=============

A quick disclaimer on backwards-compatibility for Toyplot users:

Toyplot follows the `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ standard for
assigning version numbers in a way that has specific meaning.  As of this
writing Toyplot releases are still in the `0.y.z` development phase, which
means (among other things) that the API may change at any time.  We try not to
be abusive about it, and in practice there have been very few breaking changes
in Toyplot's history, but they can and will happen on the road to the 1.0
release, and you should be prepared for it.
