Toyplot Javascript API
======================

Because interactive web-enabled plots are the default output format for
Toyplot, Javascript code generation plays an important role in the rendering
process.

The modules documented in this section are for use when creating your own
custom marks to include in Toyplot figures.  They are not needed for casual
Toyplot users.
